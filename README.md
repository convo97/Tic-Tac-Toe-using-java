# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in Java

This is a simple console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Java. The game is designed for two players playing on the same machine in turns, using a 3x3 board.

## üìã Features

- Two-player game: "X" and "O"
- Turn-based input via console
- Input validation for invalid or occupied cells
- Automatically detects wins, losses, or draws
- Easy-to-read board display in the terminal

## üß† How the Game Works

- The board is represented as a 1D array of size 9.
- Each slot is initially numbered from 1 to 9.
- Players take turns to enter the slot number to place their symbol (`X` or `O`).
- The game continues until:
  - A player gets three in a row (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal), or
  - All cells are filled, resulting in a draw.
